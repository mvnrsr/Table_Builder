# Table Builder for DP PH

## Description

This project focuses on streamlining data processing for the Philippine market, particularly in creating syntax for tabulating survey data. It aims to address the challenges faced in syntax creation and to improve efficiency in handling survey data. The motivation behind this project stems from my own experiences and the needs identified within the data processing community.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (latest version recommended)
- Pandas library
- openpyxl library

### Installation

Currently, there is no executable software for this project. Users must have Python installed along with the Pandas and openpyxl libraries. Installation instructions for these dependencies can be found on their respective websites.

## Usage

To use this project, the DP must utilize the analysis specification file from AGT, which follows a specific format of headers. The software generates syntax for tabulating survey data and flags any missing input from the CS team.

## Features

- Generates table syntax for loop and non-loop variables
- Detects average number of mentions and mean requirements
- Creates a log file for any missing input
- Limited to table syntax for specific types of variables

## Built With

- Python
- Pandas
- openpyxl
- Utilizes xlsx files for data input and output

## Limitations

This application is currently limited in its capacity to handle only certain types of table syntax and data formats. It's under continuous development to expand its capabilities.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially from those familiar with the specific needs of the data processing community in the Philippines. You can contribute by:

- Requesting features
- Testing the software
